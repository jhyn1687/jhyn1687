### Hey!

I am a new-grad in Computer Science looking to break into the SWE field. My most recent projects have been front-end development, but I love learning about (and, in the future, creating) groundbreaking tech.

In my free time I enjoy playing video games, but I also have a passion for making them. In 2023, I worked on HoloDash with my fellow classmates. You can check it out on the [HoloDash Dev Website](https://holodash.jhyn.dev/).

Right now, I'm working at the Center for Reproducible Biomedical Modeling on [Reproducibility Portal](https://reproducibilityportal.org).
